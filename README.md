# Digital Image Processing
## NTU CSIE 2019 Spring, Dr. Ming-Sui (Amy) Lee

### Course Outline
The goal of this course is to let students learn theoretical foundations and modern applications in digital image processing.

This course covers theoretical foundations and modern applications in digital image processing. Linear algebra, probability and calculus are the prerequisite of this course. It is expected that students have good programming skills in C/C++ which are required for programming assignments. The outline of this course is given as follows.

1. Introduction
2. Digital Image Fundamentals
3. Image Enhancement
4. Edge Detection
5. Geometrical Modification
6. Morphological Processing
7. Texture Analysis
8. Document Processing
